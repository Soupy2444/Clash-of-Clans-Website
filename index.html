		<h2>Welcome to Town Hall 7!</h2>
		<p>At Town Hall 7, you'll unlock several new buildings and troops, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Dark Elixir Storage</b> - This is when the third resource gets added. This is where the Dark Elixir is stored.</li>
			<li><b>Dark Elixir Drill</b> - This is like the gold and elixir mines. This one is much slower and drills for Dark Elixir. </li>
			<li><b>Dark Barracks</b> - Like the regular barracks, but the Dark Barracks allows you to train troops using Dark Elixir. </li>
			<li><b>Barbarian King</b> - This is where the game becomes a lot of fun. The Barbarian King is not like the other troops. You buy him once and he is there to defend your base and attack with you. He uses Dark Elixir to be upgraded and has a special ability when he reaches level five. </li>
			<li><b>Hidden Tesla</b> - This is another defense. This one has a catch, it's hidden from the attacker until they come in a certain radius then is pops up. </li>
			<li><b>Seeking Air Mine</b> - This is like a regular air mine, but when it comes in the radius of an attacker it will follow the troop then explode cause the most damage it can. </li>
			<li><b>Dragons</b> - This is another troop. The Dragon is a slow flying troop that deals high damage and is paired with high health. </li>
			<li><b>Minions</b> - This is the first dark elixir troop. They are pretty much a flying archer. </li>
			<li><b>Hog Riders</b> - This is the second dark elixir troop. The Hog Rider has medium damage matched with medium health. What makes them stick out is they can jump over walls. </li>
			<li><b>Rage Spell</b> - The rage spell is one of the most popular spells. When dropped and troops are in the radius it increases the troops damage and speed making them destory everything in their path.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>With these new buildings and troops, you'll be able to defend your base more effectively and launch more powerful attacks on your enemies.</p>
